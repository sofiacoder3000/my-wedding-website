  AWS CodeBuild buildspec.yml
  The dependencies are downloaded and the binary built outside of the GOPATH.
  This requies special consideration is necessary. GOROOT is not set by default.
  GOPATH is set to /go. GOBIN is necessary for the prebuild go get phase.
  The repo source must be installed to the GOPATH.
